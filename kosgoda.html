        <h2>KOSGODA  HACHERY</h2>
        <img src="./bey_Kosgoda_530x420.jpg" alt="kosgodahachery">
        <p>The Kosgoda Turtle Conservation Project is a turtle hatchery and conservation center located in the town of Kosgoda in Sri Lanka. It was established in 1981 with the aim of protecting sea turtles from extinction and educating the public about the importance of conservation. The hatchery collects turtle eggs that have been laid on the beach and protects them until they hatch, at which point the baby turtles are released into the ocean. The hatchery also takes care of injured turtles and helps to rehabilitate them. Visitors can learn about the different species of turtles found in Sri Lanka and the conservation efforts being made to protect them.<br>
        The hatchery serves as a vital sanctuary for several species of sea turtles, including the Olive Ridley, Green, Hawksbill, and Loggerhead turtles. The primary objective of the Kosgoda Hatchery is to provide a safe and nurturing environment for turtle eggs to hatch and to protect the hatchlings until they are ready to be released into the ocean.<br>
        Visiting the Kosgoda Hatchery offers a unique opportunity to witness various stages of the turtle conservation process. The center actively collects turtle eggs that are at risk from vulnerable nesting sites along the nearby beaches. The eggs are then carefully transferred to the hatchery, where they are placed in specially designed incubation chambers to ensure optimal conditions for their development.Once the eggs hatch, the baby turtles are carefully nurtured within the hatchery. Visitors to the center can observe these adorable hatchlings up close and learn about the different species of sea turtles, their life cycles, and the challenges they face in the wild. The knowledgeable staff at the hatchery provides insightful explanations and educates visitors on the importance of sea turtle conservation efforts.Besides nurturing hatchlings, the Kosgoda Hatchery also plays a vital role in rescuing and rehabilitating injured or disabled sea turtles.<br>b The center provides medical care and rehabilitation facilities to these turtles, aiming to release them back into their natural habitat once they have recovered.In addition to its conservation efforts, the Kosgoda Hatchery actively engages in community outreach and educational programs. They collaborate with local communities, schools, and other organizations to raise awareness about sea turtle conservation and promote sustainable practices to protect the marine ecosystem.Overall, the Kosgoda Hatchery is not only a sanctuary for sea turtles but also an educational and conservation hub that emphasizes the significance of preserving these magnificent creatures and their fragile habitats. It offers visitors a memorable experience, allowing them to appreciate the beauty of sea turtles and understand the importance of conservation efforts for their long-term survival.

                <h1>MADU RIVER</h1>
                <p>Madu Ganga, situated close to the town of Balapitiya in Sri Lanka's Galle District, has become an increasingly popular destination for boat safaris because of the variety of attractions. The name "Madu Ganga" meaning “Madu River”, is also spelt “Maduganga” or “Madhu Ganga”.The amphibic landscape of Maduganga is Sri Lanka's largest remaining mangrove swamp, home to several fish and reptile species. It's a fantastic birding territory, too. Together with the smaller Randombe Lake, which is situated closer to the ocean, but further south, and linked with Madu River by two natural channels, it forms the Madu Ganga Wetland, inhabited by more than 300 species of plants and  almost 250 species of vertebrate animals. Due to its rich biodiversity, Madu Ganga was listed under the International Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands.</p>

                <h1>GALLE PORT</h1>
                <p>Galle harbour was a major harbour in the country, which was in use even during the pre-Christian times, but gained importance after the 12th century.By the 14th century, Galle harbour was the most important harbour in Sri Lanka and retained its importance until 1873 when an artificial harbour was built in Colombo. After the construction of Galle Fort in the 17th century Galle port was a major port in the Indian Ocean for more than 200 years, which was an important anchorage for boats and ships traveling between Europe and Asia.When the British colonial government constructed breakwaters in the Colombo Harbour in late 19th century, much international marine traffic shifted to Colombo from Galle.Thereafter Galle port became a secondary port of the country, though it still handles some ships and boats.</p>
