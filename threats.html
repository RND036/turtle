        <div class="threats-p">
            <p>Seven different species of sea (or marine) turtles grace our ocean waters, from the shallow seagrass beds of the Indian Ocean, to the colorful reefs of the Coral Triangle and the sandy beaches of the Eastern Pacific. While these highly migratory species periodically come ashore to either bask or nest, sea turtles spend the bulk of their lives in the ocean. TURTLE SAVIOURS's work on sea turtles focuses on five of those species: green, hawksbill, loggerhead, leatherback, and olive ridley.Over the last 200 years, human activities have tipped the scales against the survival of these ancient mariners. Slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin, and shells, sea turtles suffer from poaching and over-exploitation. They also face habitat destruction and accidental capture—known as bycatch—in fishing gear. Climate change has an impact on turtle nesting sites; it alters sand temperatures, which then affects the sex of hatchlings. Nearly all species of sea turtle are now classified as endangered, with three of the seven existing species being critically endangered.TURTLE SAVIOURS is committed to stopping the decline of sea turtles and works for the recovery of the species. We work to secure environments in which both turtles and the people that depend upon them can survive</p>

        <h2>Entanglement in fishing gear</h2>
        <img src="./1020984.jpg" alt="entanglementinfishinggearsimg">
        <p>Many marine animals, like whales, dolphins, seals, sea lions, and sea turtles become entangled in fishing gear and other marine debris as they swim or while on the beach. Many objects can entangle marine life, such as fishing gear that is being used to fish both commercially and recreationally, lost or abandoned gear, and other types of rope/line and trash, including plastic bags that find their way into the marine environment.Entanglement in fishing gear can cause considerable damage to sea turtles. Turtles can become entangled quickly by lost gear, causing them to drown or become injured. They can get tangled in the line, causing flipper amputations, or they can swallow the line causing digestive problems. Marine animals such as sea lions, turtles, seabirds can be severely injured or die from choking and entanglement in fishing line and nets.

            <h2>Consumption and illegal trade of eggs and meat</h2>
            <img src="./turtle+poaching.jfif" alt="consumption&illegal trade of eggs">
            <p>Despite laws protecting sea turtles in most countries, the illegal trade of eggs, meat, and shells of turtles continues to be a major threat to their survival. These animals are harvested for their meat and eggs which are used for human consumption and in some places are considered a delicacy. In many countries, the trade in turtle eggs is a big industry that provides income to many people.The reality in some coastal communities in the developing world is that people may not have access to jobs that can sustain their families. Our view is not that people who collect turtle eggs to sell or consume or hunt them for their meat are bad people; deciding between feeding one's family and protecting a wild animal is a difficult decision. Our hope at SEE Turtles is to help residents who live near turtle habitat earn income from tourism or involvement in conservation efforts.</p>

            <h2>Coastal development</h2>
            <img src="./coastal.jpg" alt="costaldevelopmentimg">
            <p>The human alteration of coastlines forces nesting females to use other beaches, changes the properties of nesting beaches, and contributes to the pollution of sea turtle habitat from runoff and wastewater discharge. Increased coastal populations result in increased recreation and beach going vehicles.Upon reaching sexual maturity, sea turtles generally return to the same beaches where they were hatched to lay eggs. Objects left on beaches, like beach chairs, create obstacles for nesting females, sometimes resulting in failed nesting attempts. Obstacles on beaches can also be hazards to hatchlings as they get trapped in depressions and are unable to make it to the ocean.Seawall construction creates impenetrable barriers to nesting females and causes unnatural erosion of beaches.Boats and personal watercraft are responsible for large numbers of sea turtle injuries and deaths. As coastal populations increase, boating activities increase and collisions with sea turtles that must surface to breathe, are inevitable. In Florida, most sea turtle strandings are the result of collisions with boats.</p>

            <img src="./polythine.jpg" alt="plasticandothermarinedebrisimg">
            <p>Sea turtles are affected by plastic during every stage of their life. They crawl through plastic on the way to the ocean as hatchlings, swim through it while migrating, confuse it for jellyfish (one of their favorite foods), and then crawl back through it as adults. Thousands of sea turtles, whales, and other marine mammals, and more than 1 million seabirds die each year from ocean pollution and ingestion or entanglement in marine debris.</p>

            <h2>Global warming</h2>
            <img src="./download.jfif" alt="globlewarmingffectontutrlesimg">
            <p>The effects of global warming are having enormous impacts on sea turtles and other wildlife. The rate of global warming far exceeds the abilities of animals to adapt naturally to such dramatic environmental changes. Sea level rise from the melting of polar ice is already contributing to the loss of beach and sea turtle nesting habitat. Weather extremes, also linked to climate change, mean more frequent and severe storms which alter nesting beaches, cause beach erosion, and inundate, or flood sea turtle nests.Hotter sand from increasing temperatures results in decreased hatching rates or complete nest failure. Increased sand temperatures also affect hatchlings by altering natural sex ratios, with hotter temperatures producing more female hatchlings.Sea turtles use ocean currents to travel and find prey. Warming ocean temperatures influence migratory species by altering currents and impacting the distribution and abundance of prey species. This can result in southerly species being found in more northerly regions, well outside of their normal range. Warmer water temperatures also affect coral reefs through coral bleaching which are vital to the survival of species like the hawksbill.</p>

            <p>Hawksbill sea turtles are critical to the health of coral reefs by consuming sea sponges that compete with coral for space. They are also a favorite of snorkelers and divers and help draw visitors to spots around the world, helping local economies. But the beautiful shell of the hawksbill, used to hide in the colorful reefs, is also a big reason they are endangered. In many places, artisans take the hawksbill shell (also known as "tortoiseshell") to make jewelry and other products for sale to tourists.</p>
